## Project Overview
Network-App is a small forum application, created using React, Redux and Firebase. This app enables you to create new account and have own profile, which you can update with bio, location and profile picture. On your profile you can also find  posts you recently added. As a user you are able to adding or deleting threads and comments. Threads are divided into three categories - forum, updates, jobs - depends on what you'd like to add. Each category you can filter by tags or text in search bar, and in case there are too many posts on specific page, pagination make it easy for you to navigate the website.
